# CCNP Enterprise Preparation
A repository for study materials, topologies, and notes in my studies for the CCNP Enterprise certification, covering Cisco ENCOR (350-401) and ENARSI (300-410) exam topics. This includes GNS3 lab simulations, practice questions, notes, and key concept summaries for routing, switching, security, automation, and network services.

Notes will be stored in the Repository Wiki Tab, while any files (eg. GNS3 Projects) will be stored in the repository Code tab.

## Current Plan:

### NET-499: CCNP ENCOR Preparatory Study (Fall 2025)

NET-499 is a self-directed course designed to prepare the student to take the Cisco 350-401 ENCOR exam and begin the process of preparing for the Cisco 300-410 ENARSI exam. The student will utilize their existing lab environment and purchase professional training resources to learn enterprise networking concepts through self-directed study with weekly faculty consultations. The course develops both technical expertise and essential professional skills for becoming a high-achiever including time management, self-accountability, and confident public speaking in an evolving industry.

### Cisco 300-410 ENARSI Exam Preparation (Spring 2026)

This will be done outside of a college-affiliated course.
