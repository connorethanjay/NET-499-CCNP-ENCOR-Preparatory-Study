# Tunneling Implementation Verification Checklist

## GRE Tunnel Verification
- [ ] Tunnel interfaces created and up/up
- [ ] Tunnel source/destination configured correctly
- [ ] IP addresses assigned to tunnel interfaces
- [ ] Routing protocols working over tunnel (show ip ospf neighbor)
- [ ] End-to-end connectivity through tunnel confirmed
- [ ] MTU considerations documented

## IPSec Tunnel Verification
- [ ] Crypto maps configured correctly
- [ ] ISAKMP policies defined
- [ ] IPSec transform sets created
- [ ] Interesting traffic defined (crypto ACLs)
- [ ] Security associations established (show crypto ipsec sa)
- [ ] Encrypted traffic flowing (show crypto ipsec sa detail)

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Baseline latency without tunnels
- [ ] GRE tunnel latency impact measured
- [ ] IPSec tunnel latency impact measured
- [ ] Throughput testing results documented

## Security Validation
- [ ] IPSec encryption confirmed via packet capture
- [ ] Authentication working correctly
- [ ] Key exchange successful (show crypto isakmp sa)
